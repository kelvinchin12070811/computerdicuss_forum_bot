# Computer Discuss Forum Bot

This is a multifunctional administrative bot for discord, created by
[Computer Discuss Forum](https://discord.gg/computerdicussgroup).

The original goal for creating this bot is to provide an alternative solution to the features of Discord's server
modifications which offered by other bot as premium features. And hopefully replace most of the features of other bots
and hence "flatten" to a single bot.
